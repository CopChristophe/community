## Mission and Values
To give individuals control over their data when using the web to open up innovation on the web. 

## Spec, Plan, and Documentation
To make suggestions to the the [Solid spec](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec), [Solid plan](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/plan.md), or [Solid documentation](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/documentation) please submit a pull request or an issue on github. Suggestions will be incorporated by the community manager. If there is a difference of opinion about the incorporation of a suggestion, the community managaer and relevant community members will first talk to try and find a compromise. When a compromise cannot be found the community leader will make the final judgement. 

## Community Roles
You can find a list of the [various roles within the Solid community](community-roles.md) as well as the responsibilities associated with each role. Individuals will be appointed to the roles by the community leader. 

## Community Support Meetings
There are weekly recurring [community support meetings](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/community-support-agenda-and-minutes) via online calls moderated by the community manager. Individuals with specified community roles need to attend the community support meetings if stated in their role description. To make a suggestion for an agenda item at the community support meeting please submit a pull request directly to the [community support meeting agenda](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/community-support-agenda-and-minutes). Suggestions will be incorporated by the community manager. If there is a difference of opinion about the incorporation of a suggestion, the community managaer and relevant community members will first talk to try and find a compromise. When a compromise cannot be found the community leader will make the final judgement.

## Checks and Balances
To suggest a specific change to the Solid code, submit a pull request. Pull requests will be processed as described below. 

Solid has a [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) which all community members must keep in mind when contributing to Solid. If you would like to report an issue around the code of conduct or have a concern about Solid governance, please contact the community manager or submit an issue. The community manager will tag issues related to the code of conduct with the code of conduct tag. The community manager will be responsible for proposing a solution and speaking to the relevant parties to resolve the issue. If a compromise around any difference of opinion cannot be found, the community leader will make the final judgement on a solution. 

To make suggestions around Solid governance, roles, plans, review process, themes to discuss at Solid World or for the advisory board please contact the community manager or submit an issue. The community manager will add the ‘governance suggestion’ tag to those issues. The community manager will be responsible for incorporating suggestions. If there is a difference of opinion to which a compromise cannot be met the community leader will make the final judgement.

## Processes 
Step 1. Submission
Submit a GitHub pull request if you would like to make a specific change to code or text or a GitHub issue if you would like to raise a general point. If you are working on an issue or pull request assign yourself to that issue to let everyone you are working on it.

Step 2. Consensus
Community members can share ideas and propose solutions on each pull request or issue. 

Step 3. Merge
The relevant project release manager will judge and implement the merge. If there is a difference of opinion about a merge between the contributor and the relevant project release manager, they will first talk to try and find a compromise. When a compromise cannot be found the community leader will make the final judgement.

If you are working on Solid let others know your processes.

## Solid Events
[Solid events](solid-events.md) are run by community members in various cities around the world. Solid events provide an opportunity for community members to meet and talk about Solid in person. If you decide to run a Solid event [let others know about it](solid-events.md). 

To facilitate inclusion of all interested parties the community manager organises Solid World monthly event where anyone can tune in for a one-hour conversation around a set theme. To propose a theme for Solid World conversations, contact the community manager.

## Advisory Board
The Solid advisory board has the role of constructing a plan on how to uphold the original Solid values and mission. The plan needs to promote efficient, effective, inclusive, and transparent governance. The Solid advisory board should submit the plan to the community leader via the community manager. Once the plan has been submitted the advisory board will be dismantled. Advisory board members will be appointed by the Community Leader with the support of the Community Manager. The advisory board will take part in several workshops to discuss the governance issues together. The community manager will be coordinating the workshops. If you would like to suggest an issue to be addressed by the advisory board, please contact the community manager.
