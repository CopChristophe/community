# The Solid Team 
You can find a list of the [various roles within the Solid community](community-roles.md) as well as the responsibilities associated with each role. To apply to a Solid Team role contact the community manager with your cv and motivation statement. Individuals will be appointed to the roles by the community leader. 

## Community Support Meetings
There are weekly recurring [community support meetings](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/community-support-agenda-and-minutes.md) via online calls moderated by the community manager. Individuals with specified community roles need to attend the community support meetings if stated in their role description. To make a suggestion for an agenda item at the community support meeting please submit a pull request directly to the [community support meeting agenda](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/community-support-agenda-and-minutes.md). Suggestions will be incorporated by the community manager. If there is a difference of opinion about the incorporation of a suggestion, the community managaer and relevant community members will first talk to try and find a compromise. When a compromise cannot be found the community leader will make the final judgement.

## Advisory Board
The Solid advisory board has the role of constructing a plan on how to uphold the original Solid values and mission. The plan needs to promote efficient, effective, inclusive, and transparent governance. The Solid advisory board should submit the plan to the community leader via the community manager. Once the plan has been submitted the advisory board will be dismantled. Advisory board members will be appointed by the Community Leader with the support of the Community Manager. The advisory board will take part in several workshops to discuss the governance issues together. The community manager will be coordinating the workshops. If you would like to suggest an issue to be addressed by the advisory board, please contact the community manager.

# How to Contribute
If you would like to make a suggestion submit a pull request or issue. 

To make suggestions around Solid governance, roles, plans, review process, themes to discuss at Solid World or for the advisory board please contact the community manager or submit an [issue](https://github.com/solid/community/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). The community manager will add the ‘governance suggestion’ tag to those issues. The community manager will be responsible for incorporating suggestions. If there is a difference of opinion to which a compromise cannot be met the community leader will make the final judgement.

Step 1. Submission
Submit a GitHub pull request if you would like to make a specific change to code or text or a [issue](https://github.com/solid/community/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) if you would like to raise a general point. If you are working on an issue or pull request assign yourself to that issue to let everyone you are working on it.

Step 2. Consensus
Community members can share ideas and propose solutions on each pull request or issue. 

Step 3. Merge
The relevant project release manager will judge and implement the merge. If there is a difference of opinion about a merge between the contributor and the relevant project release manager, they will first talk to try and find a compromise. When a compromise cannot be found the community leader will make the final judgement.

If you are working on Solid let others know your processes.

Suggestions will be incorporated by the community manager. If there is a difference of opinion about the incorporation of a suggestion, the community managaer and relevant community members will first talk to try and find a compromise. When a compromise cannot be found the community leader will make the final judgement.

Solid has a [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) which all community members must keep in mind when contributing to Solid. If you would like to report an [issue](https://github.com/solid/community/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) around the code of conduct or have a concern about Solid governance, please contact the community manager or submit an [issue](https://github.com/solid/community/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). The community manager will tag issues related to the code of conduct with the code of conduct tag. The community manager will be responsible for proposing a solution and speaking to the relevant parties to resolve the issue. If a compromise around any difference of opinion cannot be found, the community leader will make the final judgement on a solution.
