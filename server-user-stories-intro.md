# User Stories for the Solid Server

To enable more people to get involved, to improve code quality to
production grade and to accelerate development, I would like to hear
your User Stories for the server.

This is to better understand better what people want and need from the
server. User Stories are short descriptions of a need written from the
perspective of a user,
[see e.g. this article](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories). They
are generally of the form:

> As a *type-of-user*, I want to *some-goal* so that *some-reason*.

Now, in our case, the server is pretty strictly defined by
[the specs](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec), and so, not
everything is relevant for the development of the server, most User
Stories would be about using Solid for something, given the
server. Those are not within the scope of this effort. For example,
the story

> As a pretty distracted person, I want to record my tasks in a TODO
> list so that I won't forget them.

That'd be a great use of Solid, but it doesn't require anything from
the server that is not already specified.

An example of a User Story that would require further functionality
from the server is:

> As a father, I want to set up a server for my family and only them,
> retaining some control of my children's accounts, to keep them safe
> on the Web. 

This would require something new from the registration system, in
terms of limits on who can register and what default Access Control
Lists they will be given.

Please add your short User Stories to the [Wiki](link there). As we
gather people from the community to work on the server, a group
(consisting both of Inrupters and others committed to writing
the server) will form to go through the User Stories, find out which
are not server-relevant, and then prioritize the rest.
