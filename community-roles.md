## Community Leader
The Community Leader defines the governing vision of the Solid project, and
channels that vision into the projects and initiatives created to realize it.
They are responsible for selecting core contributors, approving official
projects and initiatives, prioritizing official project roadmaps, and have the
final say on project disputes.

## Repository Manager
The Repository Manager controls Github, NPM, and other Solid organization
properties related to the storage, management, and distribution of official
Solid projects. They are responsible for keeping these properties clean and
well-organized on the community's behalf.

## Community Manager
Community Managers are responsible for community outreach, ensuring that
community members are able to realize the full value of solid, and have what
they need to contribute value back if they choose to do so.

## Solid Core Contributor
Solid Core Contributors work across projects on initiatives that enrich the
Solid ecosystem as a whole. They must attend regular stand-ups and strategy
meetings.

## Project Core Contributor
A Project Core Contributor is a key team member on an official Solid project.
They may have issues assigned to them, review and merge pull requests, and must
attend regular stand-ups and project strategy meetings.

## Project Release Manager
The Project Release Manager is responsible for determining which features and/or
bug-fixes will make a given project release. They must attend regular stand-ups
and project strategy meetings.

## Panel Coordinator
Panel Coordinators are responsible for designing and running tests with the Solid Panelists as well as publishing test results to the Solid community. Panel Coordinators are expected to join the weekly User Testing meeting which is moderated by the Community Manager.

## Solid Panelist
Solid Panelists are individuals who are available for a range of tests over time to improve the Solid user experience. When there is a test set up by the Panel Coordinators, the Community Manager will reach out to the relevant Solid Panelists to ask if they would like to participate in that particular test. Each test will take approximately 30 minutes, Solid Panelists are not obliged to participate in all tests, and Solid Panelists can stop being on the Solid Panel at any point. Tests will be designed to improve the Solid experience.
